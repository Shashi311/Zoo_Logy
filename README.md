# Barcode Scanner
This project allows users to scan a barcode using their device's camera and fetch detailed information about the corresponding animal from a backend server. The scanned barcode is sent to the server via a POST request, and the server responds with the animal's data stored in a MongoDB database. The retrieved data is then displayed in a styled card format in a new browser tab.
